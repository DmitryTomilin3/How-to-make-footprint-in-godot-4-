# How-to-make-footprint-in-godot-4-
There are two pieces of news, one is bad and the other is good. I'll start with a good one. I've almost finished my first game in godot 4. The bad news is that I can't figure out how to create a trail that will remain after the player passes. Someone help me, please!
